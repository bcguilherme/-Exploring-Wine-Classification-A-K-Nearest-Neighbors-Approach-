# Wine Classification using k-Nearest Neighbors

This is a simple wine classification project using the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. It utilizes the wine dataset available in scikit-learn.

## Description

The code loads the wine dataset and splits it into training and test sets. It then creates two k-NN classifiers with different values of neighbors (k) and evaluates the accuracy of each classifier.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local environment.

2. Run the Python code to load the dataset, train the k-NN classifiers, and evaluate accuracy.

## Result

The code will print the accuracy of two k-NN classifiers with different numbers of neighbors.

## Dependencies

Ensure that you have scikit-learn installed in your Python environment to run this code.
